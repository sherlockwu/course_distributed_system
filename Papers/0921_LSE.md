# Analysis of Latent Sector Errors in Disk
factors that impact latent sector errors

## Background
* Disk has spare sector for failed sectors
* Errors in Disk:
	* Latent Sector Error
	* Not-Ready-Condition Errors    (cannot visit the disk)
	* Recovered Errors success when retry
* Recovery Mechanisms 
	* Remap failed sectors to spare sectors
* 

## Storage System Architecture 
* File System -> RAID -> Storage layer (checksum)
* LSE handling: 
	* storage re-map and RAID verify
	* How to determine a failed disk: according to metrics on LSE 
* Proactive Error Detection
	* Media scrubs   background check all the sectors 
	* data scrubs   compare a data between RAID copies

## Analysis Methodology

## Results 
* Factors influence LSE : disk age(large), Disk size
* LSE characteristics
	* Not independent of each other 
	* Address space Locality 
	* High temporal locality of LSE 
* Request type anlysis: Disk scrubbing detects most LSE 
* LSE is correlated with recovered errors and not-ready-condition errors

## Trends and Applications
* Error distribution has characteristic 
* RAID's scrub can base on LSE metrics wrote down
