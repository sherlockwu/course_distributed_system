# Gray Report 
Why do computers stop and what can be done about it? 

## Intro
Availability is important, outage cannot be tolerated. 

## Hardware  <- Modular redundancy
Hardware failures
* Modular
* Make module fail-fast -- either it does rightly or stops
* Redundancy 

## Analysis of Failures of a Fault-tolerant System
Software faults, system maintenance are important 

## MTBF implications
1. self-configured systems 
2. proven soft/hardware vs. fixes as soon as possible 
3. software fault-tolerance 

## Fault-tolerant Execution
* Modularity 
* Defensive Programming
* Most software faults are Heisenbug
* Process-pairs
	* many kind of mechanisms about how should the copy process should keep pace of the primary one's state
* Transactions 

## Fault-tolerant Communication

## Fault-tolerant Storage
