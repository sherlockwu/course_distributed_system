# Disk Failures
Disk Replacement different thant MTTF
Related to operating conditions, not component specific factors

## Motivation 
Statistically analysis disk failures

## Methodology 
Analyze AFR(Annualized Failure Rate) 

## Comparing disk replacement with other hardware
Large number of Disks, also more failures(but not frequency, and not must cause a node outage)

## Disk Replacement Rates 
* Disk failure relates to more outside factors, not SCSI or FC etc. 
* Definition of faulty can be tricky
* Disk replacment rates are rising significatnly over the years (not go into steady)
* Disk Replacement, not Poisoson process 

## Statistical properties of disk failures
* Disk Replacements correlate
* Distribution of time between replacements, more like Weibull, not expotential

## Conclusion 
* Disk replacement is more frequent that MTTF indicates
* Early wear-out
* Replacement is more related to disk independent factors
* Distribution of time between failures
* Correlation between disk replacements
