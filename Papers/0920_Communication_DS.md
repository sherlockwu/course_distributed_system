#Communication Behavior of a Distributed Operating System
Three workloads on Solaris MC, communications
Centeredï¼Ÿ indication 
Medium size 
Structed as two or three buffers 
Request-response time is long 

## Intro 
how modern sitributed system use of new communication techs
Three workloads
	* aggregate communication  (message traffic, size, rates)
	* commuication dependecies 

## Experimental Method

## Workload Characterization

## Message Traffic
* Message destinations (hot nodes)  count and weight of messags in/out
* Message size
* Message rates  over time  

## Message Dependencies
How long does a request-response take
deep into the ORB

## Anatomy of a Message
Count the buffer chains of each message
What are these buffer for (ORB most)
